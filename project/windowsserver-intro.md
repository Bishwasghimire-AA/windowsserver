## Introduction to Windows Server

Windows Server is one of the courses for my major in ITBBA- Infrastructure and cloud services. According to our introduction lecture by our teacher Jaana (16.01.2024), this course is going to provide us with an understanding of the Windows domain as part of the working life and corporate IT environments. Throughout the course we will be learning to work on Windows-based network environments. We will be installing and working on different software according to the needs. Our exercises will be done in the Azure Lab Services (Microsoft Azure cloud learning environment). We will be requiring a remote desktop connection (RDP).

## Installing Azure Virtual Machine

Azure Virtual Machine is installed from the Azure Lab services workspace or Labs Portal. The key difference between Azure Lab and Azure VM is that Azure Lab is the entire work environment used while the latter is a virtual computer which is connected with RDP. Hyper-V is a program developed to run virtual machines.
Upon following the installation guide provided in Moodle the installation process was straightforward. We logged into the Azure Lab Services environment from the link provided or from our course Teams channel.

After starting the Lab environment, we save and run the RDP file and connect using the user login credentials provided in the course. After few conformations we were connected successfully and a new window for our VM opened:

After installation of VM I went through the materials in the chapter 0a. Manual for Azure Machine and Hyper-V of our introduction and installation page. I installed the Hyper V manager and try to follow the instructions to change the view instead of maximizing the window but the menus seems different in materials the my Hyper V manager, I guess we will learn more in the coming lectures.
